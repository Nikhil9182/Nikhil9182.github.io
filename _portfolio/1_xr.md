My journey into XR began with curiosity about immersive technologies and quickly grew into building **real-world impactful simulators and games**.  
From multiplayer MR games to VR astronaut training, these projects highlight my passion for blending technology with innovation.

<i>Below are some examples of my MR/AR/VR projects.</i>

## Tidal Tactics – Ship Battle MR Game

A **modern twist** on the classic **Battleship board game** with both **single-player narrative mode** and **multiplayer battles**.  
Currently live on the **Meta Horizon Store (Early Access)** [**Link**](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/tidal-tactics-ship-battle/8941120229335191).

1. Contributed to both **game design** and **technical development**, brainstorming and prototyping ideas to make gameplay more **fun, strategic, and engaging**.
2. Implemented **weapon physics systems** to enhance **battle mechanics** and **immersion**.
3. Drove major **performance optimizations**, raising **frame rates** from **35–40 FPS** to **62–72 FPS** on **Meta Quest 2**.
4. Optimized **tile generation** and **network lookups** by restructuring **data flow** to send only **relevant state updates** between players.
5. Developed an **expandable avatar system**, designed to support **upcoming customizations** and **future characters**.

_Tech Stack: Unity, C#, Photon, Meta XR SDK (Shared Rooms and Colocation for Multiplayer), Git, Sentry(for issues or bugs), Meta Horizon Dashboard(Alpha/ Beta Testing, Analytics, Posts, Creative A/B testing)_

## VR Fire Training Simulator

Created an interactive VR-based training experience for **fire safety and emergency drills**,
enabling users to practice evacuation procedures, operate extinguishers, and respond to different fire scenarios in a safe, controlled environment.
Built **realistic fire propagation and smoke effects to simulate urgency**, along with AI-driven NPCs that react dynamically to the player’s actions.
This immersive training **reduces risk, improves retention, and prepares users for real-world emergencies** without exposing them to actual danger.
