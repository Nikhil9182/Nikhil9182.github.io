My journey into XR began with curiosity about immersive technologies and quickly grew into building **real-world impactful simulators and games**.  
From multiplayer MR games to VR astronaut training, these projects highlight my passion for blending technology with innovation.

<i>Below are some examples of my MR/AR/VR projects.</i>
