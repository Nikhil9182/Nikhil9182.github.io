My journey into XR began with curiosity about immersive technologies and quickly grew into building **real-world impactful simulators and games**.  
From multiplayer MR games to VR astronaut training, these projects highlight my passion for blending technology with innovation.

<i>Below are some examples of my MR/AR/VR projects.</i>

## Tidal Tactics – Ship Battle MR Game

A modern twist on the classic Battleship board game with both **single-player narrative mode** and **multiplayer battles**.  
Currently live on the **Meta Horizon Store (Early Access)** [Link](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/tidal-tactics-ship-battle/8941120229335191).

1. Contributed to both game design and technical development, brainstorming and prototyping ideas to make gameplay more fun, strategic, and engaging.
2. Implemented weapon physics systems to enhance battle mechanics and immersion.
3. Drove major performance optimizations, raising frame rates from 35–40 FPS to 62–72 FPS on Meta Quest 2.
4. Optimized tile generation and network lookups by restructuring data flow to send only relevant state updates between players.
5. Developed an expandable avatar system, designed to support upcoming customizations and future characters.

_Tech Stack: Unity, C#, Photon, Meta XR SDK (Shared Rooms and Colocation for Multiplayer), Git, Sentry(for issues or bugs), Meta Horizon Dashboard(Alpha/ Beta Testing, Analytics, Posts, Creative A/B testing)_

## Autism Workplace Simulator

Designed to help individuals with autism practice real-world office environments through interactive scenarios, building confidence for workplace interactions.
Implemented grounding techniques to reduce feelings of being overwhelmed during training.
Contributed to avatar animation and lip-sync systems, improving realism and accessibility.

_Tech Stack: Unity, Timeline, Avatar Animations and Masking, Mixamo, NVdia Ominverse(for Lip Sync) C#, Oculus SDK_

## SU-30MKI VR Maintenance & Training Simulator

Developed a **custom VR Authoring tool** for Indian Air Force engineers to create LAN-based multi-user VR training modules with rich interactions such as switches, levers, wheels, joysticks, grab-and-pick etc.
Also built a dynamic **module-loading platform** that enables seamless loading of training modules across LAN. Implemented efficient UDP-based data transmission, splitting JSON into packets to ensure reliability and prevent data loss.

_Tech Stack: Unity3D, C#, UDP Networking, JSON, Open XR, 3D Model Loader, Git_
