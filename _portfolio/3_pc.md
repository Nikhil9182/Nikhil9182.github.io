While I haven't released full-fledged PC games, I’ve worked on several **prototypes and learning projects** that showcase my experiments with **game mechanics, physics, AI, and player interactions**.  
These projects reflect my curiosity to push gameplay systems further and strengthen my foundations in PC game development.

<i>Below are some examples of my PC game prototypes and experiments.</i>

## John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt (Unity Learning Project)

Started with Unity’s official beginner project to strengthen fundamentals of **navigation, player movement, and level design**.  
I went beyond the base tutorial to add **custom mechanics** and explore new features, turning it into a more personalized prototype.

## Airplane Flight Mechanics Prototype

Built a **functional airplane controller** with **take-off, in-air movement, and landing mechanics**.  
Focused on simulating **realistic flight dynamics** using Unity’s physics system and fine-tuning movement for smoother control.

## God of War Axe Mechanic (Prototype)

Implemented a **throw-and-return weapon system** inspired by Kratos’ Leviathan Axe.  
Integrated with a **third-person character controller** to replicate **combat-inspired gameplay mechanics**, experimenting with physics and animation syncing.

## Ant Simulator

Developed a prototype simulating **ant behaviors, swarm-like movements, and environment interaction**.  
Focused on experimenting with **AI patterns**, group navigation, and emergent behavior to make the swarm feel natural.
