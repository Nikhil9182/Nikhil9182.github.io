# Nikhil Bansal 
<b>Game Developer</b>

Hey, I’m Nikhil, a Game and XR Developer with a B.Tech in Computer Science with Specialization in Graphics Design and Gaming. Over the years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from VR simulators for aerospace and space training to mobile and mixed reality games. My strength lies in combining solid programming skills with creativity to bring interactive worlds to life.

Beyond development, I enjoy traveling, working on 2D art, and playing video games — hobbies that keep me inspired and connected to the creative side of building experiences.

I’m always open to new opportunities — <i>feel free to get in touch!</i>
